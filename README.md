# template
template repo for my website

## how to

### new repo from template

1. create empty repo (on github)
2. clone/copy this (template) repo locally
3. (optional) rename the folder to match the name of the repo created at (1.)
4. update edit link in [_config.yaml](https://github.com/kappanneo/template/blob/master/_config.yaml)
5. write what you want in the README
6. commit
7. set new repo as remote (`git remote remove origin`, `git remote add ...`)
8. push (publish branch)
9. on github: go to `settings > pages` and activate gh pages on the `master` branch
10. have some patience
11. enjoy

## note
if you get here from an "edit this page" link in the website, that's a perfect example of what happens if you forget to change the defaults you get from the template. please be kind and report so fixing can happen and the bug can be ~~squashed~~ lef out of the room without any arm to neither me or the bug
